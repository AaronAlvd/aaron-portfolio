        <p>
            I am a passionate and driven student at American River College, pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Molecular Biology. My academic journey reflects a commitment to understanding biological systems and leveraging computational tools to solve complex problems.

            I completed the rigorous App Academy coding bootcamp, where I gained hands-on experience with a wide range of web development technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, React, Redux, Flask, Express, SQLAlchemy, Sequelize, and PostgreSQL. This training allowed me to build a strong foundation in software development and sharpen my problem-solving skills.

            My portfolio includes:

            Airbnb Clone: A full-stack web application developed with a teammate, showcasing my expertise in React, Redux, Express, and Sequelize.
            Document Webpage: A web application that allows users to download website templates and components, developed using Flask and SQLAlchemy.
            Social Media Application: An ongoing project built with React, Redux, Express, and Sequelize, focusing on real-time data and interactive user experiences.
            Pygame Project: A game developed using Pygame, which helped me enhance my skills in game mechanics, logic, and Python development.
            Beyond web development, I’ve integrated cutting-edge technologies like the OpenAI API into my projects.

            As a member of my college's programming club, I enjoy collaborating with peers to exchange knowledge and tackle coding challenges. I also completed the "This Way Ahead" program during high school, which enriched my understanding of the tech industry and prepared me for future opportunities.

            I’m eager to connect with professionals in both the technology and science fields to contribute to innovative solutions.
